> reading -> Multiprocessor Benchmarks and Performance Models

> 学习内容小结：

> in this subsection, the main discussion is about evaluating processor performance through benchmarking. But due to such traditional restrictions to benchmark is chiefly limited to the architecture and compiler, better data structuers and algorithms maybe give a misleading result. Then, ucbidentified 13 design patterns that they will be part of applications of the future. Next, the main discussion of The Roofline Model, how to use it to find performance bottlenecks and how to optimize the processor. How to reduce computational bottlenecks: mix floating-point operation, improve inst-level parallelism and apply SIMD; How to reduce memory bottlenecks: software prefetching and memory affinity.

> Completing the file system buffer cache

> 学习内容小结：

> The original pintos implementation of the file system, when it performs read/write operations, that will directly access the file system's underlying block device. Now, I need to add a buffer cache for the file system.

> the buffer cache structure I designed is:
```
struct buf {
  int cnt;
  bool dirty;
  struct block *dev;
  block_sector_t blockno;
  struct list_elem elem;
  uint8_t data[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE];
};
/**
* cnt: number of references to the current buffer 
* dirty: when data is only written to the buffer and not synchronized to disk, dirty is true, otherwise false
* dev: maybe always fs_device, but like fsutil.c use other device, maybe they don't need the buffer cache
* blockno: sector number, the position of read/write
* elem: list element, Data Structures for Bidirectional Chained Tables
* data: the data aera of buffer
**/
```
> when pintos need to read/write, it will use bread/bwrite, not block_read/block_write. block_read/block_write will be used in the bread/bwrite, when caching missing. If there are no free cache blocks, the LRU algorithm will be used to replace the one that meets the requirement. You need to make sure that ditry is set before replacing it, and if it is true you need to write it back to disk and replace it.

> 今日学习任务：

> Synchronize the modified contents of the buffer to disk in the idle thread, add cwd records to the pcb, and add directory support to the filesystem (partial implementation).

> 学习内容小结：

> The cwd in pcb records the inode, but in userproc only inode structure declaration and can not access to the actual data in the inode, at first thought of how to make userproc only contain inode header file on struct inode definition but has not been successful, later in rtfsc when found in the file system Then I found out in rtfsc that there is a layer of abstraction in the file system and it provides a way to get the inode (you need to add a helper function yourself).

> As far as directory support is concerned, it is currently just an update of the lookup function originally provided by pintos.

> Regarding the synchronization of data in the buffer to disk, the manual says that this is achieved by non-busy-wait sleep, but I don't have much of an idea, so I just synchronize when the current resource is free, i.e., when the idle thread is running.

> Finally, I used the originally unused area of the inode_disk to implement the file extension support

> However, I felt that the design idea was not perfect and needed a lot of modification.

### 01.09

> 今日学习时长

> 6h

> 今日学习任务

> Added support for all directory-related system calls and filesystems, though there are still issues

> 学习内容小结

> Even if you have a simple idea before implementation, but when you implement it according to your own thinking, because you don't have enough rtfsc, it will lead to some processes are not well implemented or even have conflicts, then you have to re-conceptualize and change your thinking, but the source code of pintos is still relatively complex, then I am stuck in a loop, I hope to finish it soon!

### 01.10

> 5h

> 今日学习任务

> Continuing with yesterday's mission.

> 学习内容小结

> Fixed the logic in the syscall parameter check, updated the logic in mkdir, open, write to create directories properly, and the userprog test points passed except for oom (which is supposed to be caused by files opened by cwd).

> commit log: [01.10](https://github.com/crazyofcode/cs162/commit/592aa7e4e475cc4efd3208a72dd8179b1551705c)

### 01.12

> 今日学习时长

> 4.5h

> 今日学习任务

> 缝缝补补, 跟着测试点的错误信息, 修改实现的问题

> 学习内容小节

> 主要是文件/目录的新建和删除相关操作实现的补充, 比如不能删除 pcb->cwd 的父目录和不能删除 "/" 目录等, 现在关于这两个部分的测试点还有 rm-tree 没有通过

> commit log: [01.12](https://github.com/crazyofcode/cs162/commit/4bde035a38e5dcddd2faed3fc4d6a567af5bc508)
